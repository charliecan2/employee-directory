## Usage
To use this employee directory, navigate to the [website](https://charliecan2.github.io/employee-directory/). From there, you'll see a list of 25 randomly generated employees rendered onto the page. Each employee has an image attached, a first & last name, email address, phone number, and date of birth. By clicking on the First Name table header, you'll be able to sort the employees by their first name in alphabetical order (ascending). Same thing with the table header for Last Name. Lastly, you can search for any employee by typing in their first or last name onto the search bar. Anyone with the matching characters will show up now instead.
